Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests lie broadly in formal theory and comparative politics. In particular, I'm interested in how the process by which groups make decisions — the time spent on deliberation, enforcing group discipline, and testing courses of action — shapes the outcomes of coordination and collective action.

I completed my Ph.D at Princeton in 2025. You can download my CV [here](https://ecyao.github.io/files/pdf/cv_eyao.pdf).
