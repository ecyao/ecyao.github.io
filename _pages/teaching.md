## Courses

Fall 2025: Political Science 362: **Politics and the Theory of Games** (undergraduate)
<details><summary>Course description</summary>
  <p>
This course provides an introduction to game theory and its application to politics and policy-making. The aim of the course is for students to be able to represent static and dynamic games under complete and incomplete information and how to analyze them using appropriate methods and solution concepts. Applications to political science are emphasized throughout, but the primary focus will be on gaining a solid foundation in the methods of game theory.

## Advising 

* **For current WashU students:** I am happy to speak with you about your research or student experience, irrespective of your subfield or year. Please e-mail me to set up a time, or simply stop by Seigle 288. 
* **Research assistants:** I am not recruiting research assistants at this time. 
* **Prospective PhD students:** Unfortunately, I am not able to personally recruit new PhD students. While I am happy to speak with you about relevant research, I typically do not meet with prospective applicants about their applications. Generally, it is not necessary to secure an advisor prior to your application to PhD programs in political science. There is some helpful advice on PhD admissions in political science from Chris Blattman [here](https://chrisblattman.com/blog/2022/03/25/faqs-on-phd-applications/).
