## General guidelines on Letters of Recommendation

I’m happy to support my students whenever I can, and that includes writing letters of recommendation! My main goal is to write a letter that’s both genuine and effective in helping you reach your goals. To make that happen, I have a few guidelines below for (in order) general academic letters of recommendation, letters for PhD applications, and non-academic letters of recommendation. This is to help you decide if I’m the right person to ask and to coordinate our expectations. 

## General information for _academic_ LoRs

As a new assistant professor, I want to be transparent about my junior standing. While I will write the strongest letter I can, you should strategically consider that committees often place more weight on letters from tenured, senior faculty with established reputations. This is not a reason to avoid asking me, but it is a factor you should bear in mind when assembling your list of recommenders.

My promise: I will only write genuinely positive letters. I will not write a negative or even lukewarm one, because a generic letter can do more harm than good to your chances. Given this, please be prepared that there is a good chance I may have to decline your request. If I do, please see it as my way of protecting your application. It means I sincerely believe you deserve a letter from someone who can be a strong advocate for your application and knows the details of your work better than I do. 

If you’d like me to write a letter for you, please get in touch at least *six weeks* before your first deadline. Please include the following information: 
1. What you are applying to + deadlines (a list of programs/link is sufficient) 
2. Your current CV/resume
3. A brief reminder of the course(s) you took with me
4. Briefly, what you are hoping my letter will be able to speak to/emphasize

If I agree to write you a letter of recommendation, then I may ask you to send a one-page "highlight memo." This memo is your chance to guide what goes into my letter: It's where you tell me what you’d like me to emphasize (coursework, research experience, intern experience, extracurricular/volunteer activity, anything else that you think may be pertinent.) Don’t be modest! The more details you give me, the more specific and personal my letter can be. The most useful memos are ones containing specific anecdotes and examples that I can attest to.

**Regarding deadlines:** These timelines are firm. Writing a thoughtful, detailed, and effective letter requires a significant amount of time. To ensure I can give your application the attention it deserves and be fair to all students, I cannot accommodate requests that do not respect these deadlines. If you miss a deadline, there is a very high probability that I will not be able to write your letter.

**Confidentiality.** My policy is to only write confidential letters, and this is to your direct advantage. Admissions committees give significantly more weight to letters that students have waived their right to see, as it ensures complete candor. If you are asked, please be sure to waive your right; it’s a small step that makes a big difference in how your letter is perceived and valued.

**Pre-filling my information.** To ensure accuracy, please use the following details when pre-filling my contact information on your application forms if you are asked:

- First name: Elaine
- Last name: Yao
- Position: Assistant Professor
- Department: Department of Poitical Science
- Institution: Washington University in St. Louis
- Address: 1 Brookings Dr, St. Louis MO 63130
- Email: eyao (at) wustl.edu
- Phone: +1 314-935-5810 (dept telephone) 

## LoRs for PhD applicants 

A special note for PhD applications: letters for doctoral programs are all about your research potential. For your letter to be compelling, it has to go beyond your grades and speak to your ability to become a great researcher. Hence, I can only write PhD application letters for students I’ve worked with in a research context. This usually means:
- You produced a dissertation or major research project with me as an advisor.
- You wrote an original research paper in a seminar I taught.
- You have otherwise demonstrated research potential in another direct and meaningful way.
- Please understand that if we haven’t worked together in one of the ways listed above, or if I feel I cannot endorse your work with the powerful enthusiasm a PhD application requires, I will have to decline your request. This is to protect your application from a generic letter, which can do more harm than good. My goal is to ensure you are supported by a recommender who can write about your research potential with the specific detail you deserve.

For PhD applications, I need more time and information to write a letter that speaks directly to your research potential. For this, please give me eight weeks’ notice. In addition to all the items listed in the first section, please also provide:

- A draft of your statement of purpose
- Your writing sample
  - If it is not required for your application, any materials (e.g. research papers/theses) you produced while I advised you. 
- A list of your other recommenders (who else is writing for you and in what capacity e.g., "Professor A, thesis advisor.") This helps me understand your full profile and tailor my letter to complement theirs.

## Non-academic LoRs

If you are a seeking a reference for a professional opportunity, my goal is to help you secure the strongest endorsement possible. The most effective references are always rich with specific examples of your skills and accomplishments. To help you think strategically about your recommenders, please see the guidelines below.
- If you have taken a class with me: 
  - If you have taken a course with me and performed well, I may be in a good position to write you a letter / serve as a reference. The most impactful letters stem from courses where you actively participated, excelled in your assignments, or showed a keen interest in the material.
  - If you believe I can speak to your strengths effectively, please contact me at least four weeks before your first deadline with the required materials (CV, highlight memo, job description, etc.).
- If you haven’t taken a class with me (e.g., academic mentees)
  - If I have not had the opportunity to teach you, any reference I provide would be based on our conversations and your general academic record. While I can speak to your character and progress, this type of letter tends to lack the specific examples of your skills and work that employers find most compelling.
  - Therefore, my strong advice is to first approach academics who have taught you directly. Their letters generally provide a more detailed and powerful endorsement of your abilities. If an application specifically requires a reference from your Academic Mentor, or if you have exhausted other options, I am of course available to help. In that case, please contact me well in advance (at least four weeks) so we can meet to discuss your goals.
